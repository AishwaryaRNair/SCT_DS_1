# SCT_DS_1
Creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population

This is my first project as part of the #SkillCraft Technology Internship.
The goal of this project was to visualize data to understand the distribution of variables such as age and gender in a population dataset.

✅ Imported essential Python libraries
✅ Loaded and explored the dataset
✅ Created bar charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn
✅ Derived insights from age and gender distributions

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
